# Tire Compound Impact in Formula One

This repository is a data analysis project that compares tire compounds and lap times for the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2024. Our group wanted to answer: What is the best tire compound for the Hungarian Grand Prix 2024?

## Overview

Our goal is to explore the relationship between tire compounds and lap times. We compare three compounds(soft, medium, and hard) to determine how effective they are for a driver's pace. 

### Interesting Insight

Soft tires are known for their short tire age/stint length but there quick speeds. This analysis, however, provided the opposite. The soft tires still lasted the shortest but looking at the figure below, we see that the soft tire was the slowest of the three compounds on average. The quickest average lap time for soft, was slower than both the hard and medium which is uncommon. We can conclude that the soft tire is not an opitmal choice for the Hungarian Grand Prix.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

The data comes from an open-source API [OpenF1](https://openf1.org/). It contains historical and real time F1 data. For our data, we combined driver data, lap data, and stint data.
