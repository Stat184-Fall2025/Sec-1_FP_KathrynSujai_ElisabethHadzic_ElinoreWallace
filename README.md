# Tire Compound Impact in Formula One

This repository is a data analysis project that compares tire compounds to lap times for the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2024. How does tire compound affect lap times during a race?

## Overview

Our goal is to explore the relationship between tire compounds and lap times. We compare three compounds(soft, medium, and hard) to determine how effective they are for a driver's pace. 

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

The data comes from the [OpenF1](https://openf1.org/) website. It contains historical and real time data for each session over a race weekend.

## Current Plan
